# AlertMe Drivers for Hubitat

These drivers provide support for all of the common AlertMe devices in the UK, and probably many of those available as *"Iris V1"* devices in the US. 

## Instructions

Instructions mostly live [here](https://community.hubitat.com/t/release-alertme-device-drivers) for the moment, though I should keep it here instead - and I shall when I get around to it!
