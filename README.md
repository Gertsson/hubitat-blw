# Hubitat Drivers

## Instructions

Instructions mostly live [here](https://community.hubitat.com/t/release-alertme-device-drivers) for AlertMe devices.

Details on the Salus SP600 driver are [here](https://community.hubitat.com/t/release-salus-sp600-smart-plug-with-presence).

For everything else, just click on the driver directory and there may be some documentation. Otherwise it'll live on the post on [Hubitat Community forum](https://community.hubitat.com).
